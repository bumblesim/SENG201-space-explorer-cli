How to use source code and load it into eclipse:
	- File > New > Java Project
	- name your project "explorer".
	- Right click on the src folder
	- select Import > General > File system and choose your files

Alternatively, you can create a new Java Project named "explorer", and drag and drop the src files into the src folder created within eclipse.

To run the program, type into the terminal:
java -jar sal180_srj60_SpaceExplorer.jar
